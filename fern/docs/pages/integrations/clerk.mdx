The Clerk integration for Schematic allows you to:

- Automatically import organizations and users from Clerk
- Enrich existing company profiles with stored metadata
- Assign entitlements to Clerk organizations

This integration allows you to tie entitlements to new and existing identities managed by Clerk, so you can extend your authentication implemenation and add end-to-end pricing & packaging to your application quickly.

### **Connecting Clerk to Schematic**

- navigate to integrations
- create Webhook
- get api key for import
- activate integration
- upserts identities
- updates will be captured via Webhook

### **Implement entitlements**

Once companies are imported into Schematic, you can assign plans and entitlements to them just as you would any other company via plan rules or direct targeting.

In your application, simply add flag checks where appropriate with one of our SDKs.
