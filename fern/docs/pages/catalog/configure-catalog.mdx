title: Configuring the Catalog

slug: catalog/configuration
---

The Configuration tab in the Catalog serves two purposes:

1. To define subscription lifecycle rules when subscriptions change
2. To define what plans or add ons should be user-facing and accessible via Schematic Components

Live Plans, Live Add Ons, and Plan Change Rules are only relevant if you are using Schematic with Stripe. In that case, selected plans and add ons will appear in Schematic Components and users will be able to manage their subscription directly. In all other cases, that configuration can be skipped and user-facing components will simply be read only with no option to manage subscriptions.

## Options

### Initial Plan
The plan assigned to new companies upon sign ups. This plan determines how new customers begin their journey with your service.

**Capabilities:**
- Can be a free plan attached to Stripe product
- Can be a paid plan that begins with a trial
- Can be a plan with at least one free price and no paid entitlements
- A Stripe subscription will be provisioned for this customer

**Requirements:**
- Must not require a payment method
- If linked to billing:
  - Must be trialable without auto-converting, OR
  - Must have at least one free price with no paid entitlements
- If billing-linked and not trialable, must select a free price

### Fallback Plan
The plan assigned to companies that don't have an active plan. This replaces the deprecated Default Plan functionality.

**Requirements:**
- Cannot be linked to billing (even a free plan)
- Must not be connected to any Stripe product

**When Applied:**
Companies are automatically moved to this plan when:
- Their subscription becomes inactive (unpaid, cancelled)
- Their trait-based targeting becomes inactive

### Trial Expiry Plan
The plan companies are moved to when their trial period expires.

**Requirements:**
- Must not require a payment method
- Must be either:
  - A non-billing-linked plan, OR
  - A plan with a free price
- Cannot be a trialable plan (companies can't go onto a second trial)

### Live Plans

The plans that your end users can choose to downgrade from or upgrade to. If enabled, each plan included in Live Plans will appear as an option in the checkout flow.

Companies in Schematic may be assigned plans that are not included here, but there will be no option to independently subscribe to them using Schematic Components.

### Custom Plans

Often, an enterprise plan will have custom pricing that cannot easily be displayed. In these cases, you can mark a plan as "Custom" and then provide a message like "Talk to us" to display instead of a price.

### Live Add Ons

The add ons that your end users can select. If enabled, each add on included in Live Add Ons will appear as an option in the checkout flow.

Companies in Schematic may be assigned add ons that are not included here, but there will be no option to independently subscribe to them using Schematic Components.

<Info>Live Add Ons are limited to features that can be turned on or turned off (Boolean entitlements), but metered Add Ons are coming soon.</Info>

### Trial Rules

The default trial behavior that will apply to trials when configured at the plan level.

### Plan Change Rules

The rules Schematic will validate subscription changes against (e.g. upgrade rules, downgrade rules).

## **Configuring the Catalog**

1. Navigate to **Catalog > Configuration**
2. Choose a default plan that all companies will be assigned if they do not currently have a subscription (optional)
3. Choose “Live Plans” and “Live Add Ons”
4. Save changes

<Info>Plans and Add Ons must be associated with Stripe Products to be added to Live Plans or Live Add Ons.</Info>

Trials Rules can be modified to require a credit card to start a trial. At the end of the trial, companies will automaticaly convert into the corresponding paid plan.

Currently, Plan Change Rules cannot be modified; however, we will be introducing more optionality here in the future.
