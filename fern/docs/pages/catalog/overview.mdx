The Catalog in Schematic is where plans and add ons are defined, including their entitlements and subscription lifecycle. Schematic makes it easy to implement common pricing patterns, such as:

1. [Starting new customers on a free plan](/catalog/configuration#initial-plan)
2. [Trials of paid plans](/catalog/trials)
3. [Reverse Trials (where customers start on a trial of a paid plan)](/catalog/configuration#initial-plan)
4. [Seat based plans]()
5. [Usage based plans](/billing/usage-based-billing)
6. [Credit based plans](/billing/credit-burndown)
7. Hybrid plans, combining seats and usage based billing
8. 3 or 4-tier Good, Better, Best pricing

You can also associate Catalog items to Stripe products directly to:
- Synchronize company subscriptions between the products
- Automatically provision entitlements in your application when a subscription is updated
- Enable billing elements in Schematic Components, including to power checkout, subscription management (invoices, payment method, upgrade, downgrade, expand), and cancellation
