Entitlements represent the unique relationship between a plan (or add on) and a feature. Depending on what entitlements a company has and, in the case of a metered feature, their usage relative to a given limit, you can use Schematic's feature management capabilities to grant or revoke functionality in your application.

Entitlements may be boolean or be metered, and there is no limit to the number entitlements in any given plan.
