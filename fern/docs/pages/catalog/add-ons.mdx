Add-ons are additional modules or packages that can be assigned to companies in addition to a plan. Companies can have any number of add-ons. For a step-by-step guide about creating add-ons in Schematic, click [here](/catalog/create-catalog).

There are a number of scenarios where you may want to offer add-ons, and the most common scenario is that you sell additional functionality that increases the value of your core plan (e.g. Zoom Workplace).

## Usage Based Add-ons

Add-ons can add usage-based entilements, both trait-based or event-based. When adding an usage-based entitlement to an add-on, the entitlement can either introduce a brand new entitlement or override an existing entitlement on the plan.

- **Introducing a new entitlement**: A plan currently does not allow any AI searches, but an add-on can purchased to allow AI searches on a pay as you go basis.
- **Overriding an existing entitlement**: A plan currently allows 100 AI searches per month, and an add-on can purchased to allow unlimited AI searches per month.

When adding a usage-based entitlement to an add-on, it can be configured to support 3 different pricing models:

1. **Included in plan**: The add-on will be unlimited, meaning the company can use the feature as much as they want.
2. **Pay as you go**: The company will be charged per unit of usage.
3. **Overage**: The first X units of usage are included in the base price of the add-on, and then charged per unit of usage over the limit.

For more information about these pricing models, see [Usage Based Billing](/billing/usage-based-billing) -- the priced entitlements supported by add-ons work the same for add-ons and plans. 

<Warning>Currently, Schematic does not support add-ons that set a fixed the limit of usage each month. For example, an add-on cannot grant 500 AI searches per month, (but can grant unlimited AI searches per month).</Warning>
