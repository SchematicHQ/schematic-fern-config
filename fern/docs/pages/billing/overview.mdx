Schematic integrates bi-directionally with Stripe to facilitate billing while adding powerful capabilities on top of it such as embeddable UI components, feature flags to power entitlements, and usage-based metering.

To read more about how to use our Stripe integration, including how to import and map Stripe objects, click [here](/integrations/stripe).

Key Features:
- **Stripe integration**: Connect your Stripe account to import and manage customers, products, and subscriptions.
- **Flexible Billing Models**: In addition to tier-based packaging, implement a number of usage-based billing models, including:
    - Pay-as-You-Go: Charge customers based on real-time usage.
    - Pay-in-Advance: Collect payments upfront for future usage, and enforce a hard feature limit.
    - Fixed Fee with Overage: Combine subscription pricing with the flexibility to charge for additional usage.
    - Credit Burndown: Deduct credits from a pre-purchased pool as services are used, and enforce a hard feature limit.
- **Company Management**: Manage company entitlements and subscriptions independently.

Benefits:
- **Billing and feature management in one place**: Tie feature management directly to billing policy to ensure feature access lines up with subscriptions.
- **Flexibility**: Adjust your billing and entitlements without rewriting code.
- **End user transparency**: Provide clear, user-friendly billing experiences using [Schematic Components](/components/overview) that improve trust and satisfaction.
