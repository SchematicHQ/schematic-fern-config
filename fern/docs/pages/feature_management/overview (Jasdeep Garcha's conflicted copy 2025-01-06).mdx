Feature Management in Schematic enables you to control how product features are rolled out, accessed by end customers, and monetized. Unlike traditional feature management tools, Schematic is purpose-built with billing in mind, so feature access can be tied directly to a companyâ€™s plan and any other policy set up in Schematic (e.g. add ons, overrides, or individual targeting).

Flags and Features are technically different concepts in Schematic:
- **Flags** - represent the gate that you implement in your codebase to control whether or not a resource is accessible to the end user.
- **Features** - represent an abstraction on top of flags that the business may market or sell.

## Use cases
- **Rollout new features**: Rollout gradually to a small cohort to mitigate risk or to gather feedback.
- **Line up access with subscriptions**: Ensure customers only see features tied to their subscription plans or usage limits.
- **Manage exceptions**: Selectively enable or disable features for individual customers.
- **Drive upgrades and renewals**: Enable feature trials or time-limited overrides.
- **Simplify billing implementation**: Eliminate the need for custom code by linking feature flags directly to billing.

## How can teams use Schematic feature management
- **Engineers**: Replace homegrown feature flag or metering logic and get an out of the box admin panel to manage them.
- **Product Managers**: Get fine-grained control over how much and which features are available to different customer segments.
- **GTM Teams**: Grant plan and feature trials to close deals and drive upsell.
