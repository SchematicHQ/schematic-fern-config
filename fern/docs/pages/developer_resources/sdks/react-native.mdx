Schematic's React SDK also works for React Native apps. See the [React SDK documentation](/developer_resources/sdks/react) for more details about how to use the React SDK. 

### Handling Application Backgrounding

When your application is brought back to the foreground, Schematic will automatically reconnect to the WebSocket to resume flag checks and event tracking. This will ensure that your application is always up to date with the latest flag data and event tracking.
