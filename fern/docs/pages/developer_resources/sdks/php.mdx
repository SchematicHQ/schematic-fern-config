### Installation

The PHP SDK is hosted on composer ([here](https://packagist.org/packages/schematichq/schematic-php)).

```bash
composer require schematichq/schematic-php
```

### Initialization

Initialize a client with an [API key secret](/quickstart#create-an-api-key).

```php
use Schematic\Schematic;

$schematic = new Schematic($apiKey, ['basePath' => $apiUrl]);
```

### Usage example

Once the client is initialized, you may use the SDK to make requests. Below is an example of creating a table for all companies stored in Schematic.

```php
<?php
try {
    $schematic = new Schematic($apiKey, ['basePath' => $apiUrl]);

    $response = $schematic->CompaniesApi->listCompanies();
    $companies = $response->getData();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    report($e);
}?>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Company ID</th>
            <th>Company Name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <?php foreach ($companies as $company): ?>
        <tr>
            <td><?php echo $company->getId(); ?></td>
            <td><?php echo $company->getName(); ?></td>
        </tr>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
    </tbody>
</table>
```
