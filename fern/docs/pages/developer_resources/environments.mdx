Schematic supports multiple environments (e.g. development and production) to support your development workflow.

Resources in Schematic are predominately environment-scoped, but some are available account-wide (regardless of the selected environment). The table below highlights available resources and how they are scoped.



## Account Scoped Resources

Account scoped resources are the same across all environments. For example, a plan is scoped to your entire Account, so whenever you make a plan, it is accessible across all environments. This is helpful to create new plans in development and then they'll be ready in production without additional release work.

| Resource type | Definition / Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Environment | An environment (e.g. development, staging, production) |
| Plan | A plan is a collection of features that can be assigned to a company |
| Feature | A feature is a product or service that can be enabled or disabled for a company |
| Feature flag | A feature flag is a way to enable or disable a feature for a company |

## Environment Scoped Resources

An environment scoped resource is only available in a specific environment. For example, a company is scoped to a specific environment (e.g. development), so you can setup test cases while developing to make sure all of the different billing states are covered wihtout affecting your production environment. 

| Resource type | Definition / Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Plan entitlement | A feature is associated with a plan (e.g. Pro plan allows SSO) |
| Companies | An organization that is using your product |
| Company override | An allowance for a specific company to have more entitlements than their current plan. This is often used for enterprise customers or customers on legacy plans. |
| Users | A user is an individual person |
| Events | An event is an action that you're tracking (often for usage-based billing) |
| Metric counts | This is an aggregated count of events grouped by type/hour/company/user primarily used for rule-based targeting |
| Flag rule | A rule that determines when a feature flag should be enabled or disabled, based on the context of the user or company |
| Rule condition | A condition that is part of a flag rule |

## Special Cases

API keys are always environment-specific, but can be accessed in the Application account-wide.


## TO DROP (leaving here for discussion)

I think these can be implicitly understood without needing a callout.

| Entity key type | Account | API | App & API | A type of key that can be used to look up an entity (user or company). For example, “email” or “id” |
| Entity trait type | Account | API | App & API | Arbitrary data that can be attached to entities (Users/Companies), which can later be used for flag targeting via rule conditions. This model defines a type of trait, e.g. “location” being a string |
| Entity key value | Environment | API | App & API | The value for a given entity key, e.g. the value “ben@schematichq.com” in the context of the key “email” as a lookup for a specific user |
| Entity trait value | Environment | API | API | The value for a given entity trait, e.g. the value “Atlanta, GA” in the context of the “location” trait for a specific  |
