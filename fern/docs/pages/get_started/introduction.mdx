Schematic is the entitlement layer for B2B SaaS applications. We sit between your product and your billing system, giving you a single source of truth for who has access to what—and automating the enforcement of plans, limits, and usage across your application.

## Why teams use Schematic

**For GTM teams:** Launch plans, change limits, manage trials, and grant customer exceptions—all without engineering tickets. If you can imagine a pricing change, you can ship it yourself.

**For Engineering teams:** Stop maintaining entitlement infrastructure. No syncing billing state across systems, no feature flag sprawl for plan logic, no building usage metering systems, no manual database overrides when Sales needs an exception.

With Schematic, teams ship pricing changes faster, reduce engineering overhead, and get out of billing projects forever.

## How Schematic works with Stripe
**Stripe handles billing and payments. Schematic handles entitlements and plan enforcement.**

We keep the two in sync automatically, so Stripe remains your source of truth for subscriptions while your application gets a clean API for access control and usage tracking.
What this means in practice:

- **Stripe stays your payment processor** - All subscription and payment data lives in Stripe
- **Schematic adds the entitlement layer** - Plan limits, feature access, usage metering, and customer overrides
- **Automatic sync** - No webhook handlers to maintain, no billing state to reconcile
- **Clean separation** - GTM can modify packaging in Schematic without touching Stripe configuration

This architecture lets you adopt sophisticated pricing models (usage-based, hybrid, seat-based, feature-gated) without rebuilding your billing infrastructure or tightly coupling pricing logic into your application code.

## What you can do with Schematic

### Enforce entitlements with Feature Flags

[Control which customers access which features](/feature-management/overview) based on their plan, usage, or custom rules—without touching application code. Update limits, bundle features, or create custom configurations from the Schematic dashboard.

### Track usage with Metering

[Automatically track customer usage](/feature-management/tracking-usage) for billing, enforcing limits, or telemetry. Usage events can be attributed to companies, users, or features, forming the basis for usage-based pricing and customer insights.

### Embed UI Components

[Add pre-built components](/components/overview) for checkout, upgrade/downgrade flows, customer portals, pricing tables, and usage meters. Give customers self-service control while maintaining consistent branding
### Manage the entire customer lifecycle

Get a 360-degree view combining account data, usage patterns, and billing status. Power internal workflows for sales, support, and account management with complete customer context.

### Handle exceptions gracefully

Grant temporary access, apply credits, create custom plans, or [override limits](/feature-management/overrides) for individual customers—all through the dashboard or API, no code changes required.

## Core concepts

### Plans and Add Ons (Catalog)

[Define your pricing structure](/catalog/overview) with plans and add ons. Each includes entitlements (features, limits, usage allowances) and pricing. Plans map to Stripe subscriptions automatically.

### Company Profiles

A centralized record aggregating company information, subscription details, and usage data. Profiles are key-based (preventing duplicates) and can reference multiple identifiers across systems.

### Feature Flags

[Control access to features](/feature-management/overview) based on company context, subscription status, or custom attributes. Flags reference entitlements from Plans to enforce access rules automatically.

### Subscriptions

[Stripe subscriptions](/integrations/stripe) automatically link to Company Profiles. Companies can have membership in multiple Plans or add ons simultaneously, with the most permissive entitlements applying.

### Metering

[Track usage events](/feature-management/tracking-usage) for monetization or enforcement. Events can be attributed to companies, users, or features, supporting flexible usage-based models or packaged limits.
