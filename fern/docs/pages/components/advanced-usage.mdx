The Schematic Components library provides several advanced features for customizing and extending the default behavior.

## Launch Checkout Programmatically

A common billing use case is to present a user with a paywall, and then open a checkout flow to quickly allow them to upgrade their plan.

Imagine a user is trying to create their 6th AI-generated image, but their current plan only includes 5 images per month. You can present them a paywall explaining they are at their limit and prove an "Upgrade to the Pro Plan" button. When they click the upgrade button, you can create a seamless upgrade experience by:

1. Opening the checkout flow
2. Pre-selecting the Pro plan they need to upgrade to
3. Taking them directly to the payment step

Here's a barebones implementation of this:

```CustonCheckout.tsx
import {
  CheckoutDialog,
  EmbedProvider,
  useEmbed,
} from "@schematichq/schematic-components";
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react";

function Checkout() {
  const { layout, stale, hydrate, setAccessToken, setLayout, setCheckoutState } = useEmbed();

  const checkout = useCallback(async () => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/accessToken");
    const result = await response.json();
    setAccessToken(result.accessToken);
    setCheckoutState({ planId: "plan_abc123" })
    setLayout("checkout");
  }, [setAccessToken, setLayout, setCheckoutState]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (stale) {
      hydrate();
    }
  }, [stale, hydrate]);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={checkout}>Upgrade to Pro</button>
      {layout === "checkout" && <CheckoutDialog />}
    </>
  )
}

export default function CustomCheckout() {
  return (
    <EmbedProvider>
      <Checkout />
    </EmbedProvider>
  );
}
```

The key difference here is that instead of rendering our component by default, we're rendering it in reaction to a user action (clicking the "Upgrade to Pro" button). When this button is clicked:

1. We fetch an access token from our backend
2. Provide it to the component
3. Call `setLayout("checkout")`. `layout` determines which screen the checkout flow is currently on.
4. Because `layout` now has a value, the `CheckoutDialog` component will be rendered.

### Additional Options

There are additional ways you can control the component state when programmatically launching. These are unlikely to be needed in most cases, but are documented here for completeness.

{/* #### Control which checkout step is loaded

If a `planId` is provided to `setCheckoutState`, the checkout flow will start with the provided plan selected plan and will move onto the next step. 

You can additionally control which step you begin by one of the following keys to true. 

| Value | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `setCheckoutState({ usage: true})` | The step to set any pay in advance entitlements. This tab only appears if the selected plan has pay in advance entitlements. | 
| `setCheckoutState({ addons: true})` | The step to select add-ons. This tab only appears if the selected plan has add-ons. |
| `setCheckoutState({ addOnUsage: true})` | The step to set any pay in advance entitlements from a selected add-on. This step only appears if an add-on with pay in advance entitlements is selected. |
| `setCheckoutState({ credits: true})` | The step to purchase credit bundles. This step only appears if the selected plan has a credit type associated with it. |

<Note>
  Because the final checkout step requires coordination with Stripe, there is currently no way to select the final checkout step as the step that should load. 
</Note> */}

#### Control which component is rendered

In addition to the checkout flow, you can also load other parts of the Schematic Components library instead. To do this, you'll set a different value in `setLayout`. The accepted values are:

| Layout | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `portal` | The customer portal and default starting page for Schematic Components. If you want this, just load a component using the default setup. |
| `checkout` | The checkout flow, and usage is documented above. |
| `payment` | The payment method configuration step of the checkout flow. |
| `unsubscribe` | The unsubscribe flow. This is normally handled by adding an Unsubscribe button to your portal using the component builder. |
| `disabled` | Renders an error message. This is typically used internally when the access token is invalid or missing. |
