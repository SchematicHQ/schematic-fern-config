Schematic Components are made up of a number of Elements that can be optionally added in the builder. Each Element has it's own customization options.

Currently, we support the following Elements:

| Element | Included by Default | Requires Stripe Integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current Plan | Yes | Readonly without Stripe |
| Included Features | Yes | No |
| Next Bill Due | Yes | Yes |
| Payment Methods | Yes | Yes |
| Invoices | No | Yes |
| Unsubscribe Button | No | No |
| Metered Features | No | No |
| Pricing Table | No | Yes |
| Text | No | No |
| Button | No | No |

If Stripe is not connected to Schematic, some Elements will either be unavailable or fall back to a read only experience.

#### Current Plan

The Current Plan Element shows the Schematic Plan the Customer is currently subscribed to. 

If Stripe is connected, it also optionally includes a button for users to self manage their plan (e.g. switch plans, add add-ons). This will open up the checkout flow to allow users to purchase a new plan or add-on.

*Note: Customers cannot cancel their subscription through this button. See the Unsubscribe Button Element for this functionality.*

#### Pricing Table

The Pricing Table is typically used as a standalone component that can be embedded into your marketing site. If this is what you're looking for, see the [Pricing Table](/components/pricing-table) page.

The pricing table _can_ be embedded into your Customer Portal, but this is not a recommended use case.

## Styling Options

Each element in the Customer Portal can be styled to match your brand. In addition to the styling options above, all font, text color, background color, button size, and button colors can be customized. 

Here is an example of a customized portal from the [Schematic Weather Demo App](https://schematic-next-example.vercel.app/):
