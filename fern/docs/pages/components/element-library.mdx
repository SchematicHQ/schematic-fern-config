Schematic Components are made up of a number of Elements that can be optionally added in the builder. Each Element has it’s own customization options.

If Stripe is not connected to Schematic, some Elements will either be unavailable or fall back to a read only experience.

| Element | Element Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current Plan | Entitlements | Partially available without Stripe connected (read only) |
| Included Features | Entitlements | Available with or without Stripe connected |
| Next Bill Due | Billing | Not available unless Stripe is connected |
| Payment Methods | Billing | Not available unless Stripe is connected |
| Invoices | Billing | Not available unless Stripe is connected |
| Metered Features | Entitlements | Available with or without Stripe connected |
| Pricing Table | Entitlements | Not available unless Stripe is connected |

Below, each Element that is currently available is highlighted (with plans for many more soon!). 

#### **Current Plan**

The Current Plan Element reflects the Schematic Plan a Company is a member of and the associated metadata. It also optionally includes a button for end users to self manage their plan. If Stripe is connected, any changes made to a Company’s plan will reflect in Schematic and Stripe; if it is not, this element is read only.
