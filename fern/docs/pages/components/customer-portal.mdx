title: Customer Portal and Checkout Flow

slug: components/customer-portal
---

Schematic provides a customizable customer portal and checkout flow that allows your customers to easily complete common billing tasks like:
1. Purchasing a plan or add-on
2. Upgrading, downgrading, or canceling their subscription
3. View upcoming and past invoices
4. Check current usage and entitlements

This component integrates fully with Stripe and is intended to replace Stripe's native checkout flow. Schematic components will sync any changes to the subscription to Stripe.

Additionally, Schematic provides a component builder so the content and styling of the customer portal can be customized to match your use case and brand.

## Stripe Integration

Schematic Customer Portal handles the complete checkout flow for a new customer, upgrade, downgrade, or cancellation. This includes propogating the appropriate events to Stripe to handle payment and create/update the customer's subscription (these changes are also reflected in Schematic). If Stripe is connected, the Customer Portal will automatically interface with Stripe with no additional configuration required. To learn more about the Stripe integration, see the [Stripe Integration](/integrations/stripe) page. d
