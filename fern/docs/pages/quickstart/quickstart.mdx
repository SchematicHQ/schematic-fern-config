Schematic is the quickest way to handle billing and feature flags. Implementing Schematic in your application makes it easy for non-developers to manage most billing and subscription scenarios, freeing up developers to focus on what makes your product great. 

Getting started is only a few steps:

1. [Create a Schematic account](./account-setup)
    - *(Optional)* Connect your Stripe account
2. [Setup the Schematic SDK](./setup-sdk)
3. [Create and use your first feature flag](./setup-sdk#check-a-flag)
