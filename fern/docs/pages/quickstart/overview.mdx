Schematic is the quickest way to handle billing and subscription management. Implementing Schematic in your application makes it easy for non-developers to manage most billing and subscription scenarios, freeing up developers to focus on what makes your product great. 

There are 2 great ways to explore Schematic:

1. Clone our [quickstart project](https://github.com/schematichq/schematic-quickstart). You'll need a Schematic account to get started, and the quickstart will walk you through the rest!
2. Explore a hosted version of the [quickstart app online](https://schematic-demo-hosted-schematichq.vercel.app/entitlements).

Either way, you'll be able to see Schematic features in action. The quickstart app also links back to these docs to explore the features you're most interested in, including:

- [Setup your Schematic Account](/quickstart/account-setup)
- [Creating and managing entitlements](/quickstart/entitling-a-feature)
- [Tracking usage](/quickstart/tracking-usage)
- [Registering users and companies in Schematic](/quickstart/identifying-users)
{/* - [Deploying our pre-built UI components (like customer portals, meters, and paywalls)](/quickstart/deploying-ui-components) */}

Each of the steps above includes a written and video tutorial demostrating the feature and how to implement it.

## Where to start?

First, [setup your account](/quickstart/account-setup) and provide the quickstart the api key that it needs.
