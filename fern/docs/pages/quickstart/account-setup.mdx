First, you'll need to create a Schematic account. This is free and will only take a few minutes. 

## 1. Create an account
Go to [Schematic](https://app.schematichq.com/sign-in) and create an account with your Google account, or Github account, or email.

This flow will ask you a few simple questions. 

## 2. Link your Stripe account?

Skip this step for now. When you're ready, checkout our [Stripe Integration](/integrations/stripe) docs for more information.

## 3. Create an API Key

<li>Next, we'll need to create a Schematic api key.

            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Add your Schematic publishable key and secret key to the `.env.local` file. (We'll add the component id later)</li>
          <li>Restart this application and you should be good to go!</li>

### You're done!

You've now created your first Entitlement of "Mechanical Keyboards" and added it to the "Developers" Plan.

Next, we'll look at integrating the Schematic SDK into your application, to make sure that developers always have access to mechanical keyboards.


*NOTE: To simplify this quickstart and demonstrate key Schematic features, each new account is provisioned with a demo customer, plan, and a few features. This quickstart is designed to leverage those to help guide you through Schematic. Feel free to delete those when you're ready.*
