description: The 3 different types of features in Schematic -- Boolean, Trait-based, and Event-based.
---

There are 3 different types of features in Schematic
- **Boolean** - A simple on/off feature.
- **Event-based** - A feature that is metered against user events reported to Schematic (e.g. api calls, reports generated).
- **Trait-based** - A feature that is based off of information reported to Schematic. This can be usage (e.g. seats) or metadata (e.g. company size).

## Boolean Features

Boolean features are the simplest type of feature. They are often used to represent features that are either available or not available to a user. They are the most commonly used type of feature and are the backbone of most plans. 

## Event-based Features

Event-based features are features that are metered against user events reported to Schematic. This can be usage (e.g. api calls, reports generated). Events are sent to Schematic via the `track` function provided by each SDK. Schematic automatically aggregates these events to dynamically determine whether a company has exceeded their entitlement.

## Trait-based Features

Trait-based features are features based off of information reported to Schematic. This can be usage (e.g. seats) or metadata (e.g. company size). Traits can be updated via the `POST /companies` in [the API](/api-reference/companies/upsert-company) or via the `upsertCompany` or `identify` functions provided by each SDK.

### Usage-based Traits

Traits can be used to supply usage information that is more easily managed in your application:  user seats are a common example. Whenever a company adds or removes a seat, the updateed value should be provided to Schematic. Unlike event tracking, the current value should be passed each time: this means usage of a trait based feature can increase or decrease (unlike event-based features). 

While not necessary, there are a few advantages of tracking and managing these features in Schematic:

1. Centralize customer usage data as it pertains to monetization
2. Seamlessly leverage customer overrides for these features in your application

### Metadata-based Traits

Metadata can be provided to Schematic for use in pricing and plan management. The most common example is to apply a plan to customers based off of a trait. This is commonly used when migrating from a legacy system of plan management.
