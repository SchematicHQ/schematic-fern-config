description: The 3 different types of features in Schematic -- Boolean, Trait-based, and Event-based.
---

There are 3 different types of features in Schematic
- **Boolean** - A simple on/off feature.
- **Event-based** - A feature that is metered against events reported to Schematic (e.g. api calls, reports generated).
- **Trait-based** - A feature that is based off of information reported to Schematic. This can be usage (e.g. seats) or metadata (e.g. company size).

## Boolean Features

Boolean features are the simplest type of feature. They are often used to represent features that are either available or not available to a user or company. They are the most commonly used type of feature and are the backbone of most plans. 

## Event-based Features

Event-based features are features that are metered against user events reported to Schematic. This can be usage (e.g. api calls, reports generated). Events are sent to Schematic via the `track` function provided by each SDK. Schematic automatically aggregates these events to dynamically determine whether a company has exceeded their entitlement.

## Trait-based Features

Trait-based features are features based off of information reported to Schematic. Common examples includes seats, projects, or devices. In each case, the value is something you track outside of Schematic, and then report to Schematic when it changes. 

Traits can be updated via the `POST /companies` in [the API](/api-reference/companies/upsert-company) or via the `upsertCompany` or `identify` functions provided by each SDK.

### Why Report Usage to Schematic?

Instead of reporting usage to Schematic, you could pull the limit set in Schematic and enforce access in your application directly. However, usage reported to Schematic has a few advantages:

1. Centralize customer usage data as it pertains to monetization
2. Seamlessly leverage customer overrides for these features in your application
3. Use Schematic's usage analytics to understand usage patterns and customer health

For these reasons, we recommend reporting usage to Schematic whenever possible.
